# Access Control in VANET

* **CURRENT STATE: ** Just initiated, forked from [veins example](https://github.com/sommer/veins/tree/66cf3d8211c8e23b5ecc9b0b086443b8ac47f2d9/examples/veins)

This simulation requires veins_launchd to be started and listening for 
connections on a TCP socket, e.g. run this:

```sh
veins_launchd -vv
```

### Map

Patna ke ek bade area ka map use kr rhe hai, it is in `osm/` directory

### Extras

Wrote a proposal intentionally to look like research papers (the content may not be though), check it in the `papers/` directory.
